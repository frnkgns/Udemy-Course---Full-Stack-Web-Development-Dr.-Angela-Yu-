// In programming PEMDAS are followed  

// 1. Dog Age to Human Age Formula
var dog = 7;
var HumanAge = (dog - 2) * 4 + 21;
console.log(HumanAge);

// 2. Increment and Decrement
var x = 5;              
var y = x++;            //x increase value while the y gets the original value of x since only x has ++
console.log(y += 1);    //that is why the value is 6
